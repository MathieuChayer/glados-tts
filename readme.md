# Glados virtual assistant

Based on the work of R2D2FISH and nerdaxic, this project aims to 
build a simple virtual assistant with the voice and attitude of the
evil GladOS from the Portal Franchise.

You just have to run glados.py and type in your commands ! 

So far, the virtual assistance has a few simple skills :

- Greet the user
- Tell the date
- Tell the time
- Tell the weather
- Tell a joke
- Repeat (Ex: say the cake is waiting)
- Open a web page (Ex: Open google, Open reddit.com)
- Consult wikipedia (Ex : wikipedia atomic bomb)

### Futur objectives :
- Add skills ! 
- Add Speech recognition for voice commands
